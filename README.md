# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project focuses on the Back-End functionality for the WTWR application. Users are able to create, add, or remove Clothing Items and Like or Dislike Clothing Items. Users can also get a list of all current users along with create and removing them as well. It utilizes Express.js in order to handle client requests and Mongoose schemas in order the handle the Back-End data from MongoDB. All endpoints and requests are tested through Postman. 

## Technologies
Express.js was used as the framework for building the API and managing routes. The Mongoose Library was used to build the Schemas to create the User and ClothingItem data for users and to be later saved to MongoDB. Linter was used to maintain code consistency along with Prettier.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
